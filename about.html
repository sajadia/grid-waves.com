							I grew up in East Side of Tehran, Iran. I earned my high school diploma in Physics and Mathematics in 2004. Then, I earned the Bachelor's of Science degree, majoring in Electrical Power Engineering, graduating in 2009. My undergraduate program installed an understanding in a variety of topics including fundamentals of engineering, advanced mathematics and physics, electromagnetics, energy conversion, power system analysis, transmission and distribution systems, and electrical machines.
						</p>
						<p>
							My graduate studies was in an integrated, international study program, jointly delivered by highly-regarded international institutions including: Warsaw University of Technology in Poland, RWTH Aachen University in Germany, École Polytechnique in France, and University of Waterloo in Canada. This program consisted of courses, labs, and research in a wide range of advanced topics including power systems analysis, stability, and dynamics, energy market, natural gas systems, power electronics, numerical methods, energy policy, and innovation and intellectual property management.
						</p>
						<p>
							I completed the Master's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in July 2012. My master's thesis research, under the direction of dr hab. inż. Piotr Biczel, looked into the application of artificial intelligent control for power systems applications. After an investigation of voltage regulation methods in power distribution feeders, I designed a communication based fuzzy control scheme for voltage regulation in the smart distribution feeders.
						</p>
						<p>
							After graduation from the master's program, I was awarded a Fellowship by the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter to spend my summer attending a summer school in Boulder, CO, co-sponsered by the University of Colorado Boulder and National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). This school focused on a broad spectrum of topics such as energy policy, economics, energy management, and materials for renewable energy systems. During this time, I had the opportunity to learn from prominent scholars and policy makers including Governor Hickenlooper and the Nobel Prize laureate Prof. Paul Komor.
						</p>
						<p>
							In January 2013, I started my Ph.D. at the Case Western Reserve University. This program offered advanced teaching and research in large-scale and complex dynamical systems, convex optimization, advanced topics in stability and control of systems, digital signal processing, and data analytics, majoring in their application in electric power systems. I also conducted multiple training sessions at the EPRI and GE for their power system analysis platforms.
						</p>
						<p>
							From Spring 2013 through Fall 2014, I had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for EECS 397: Introduction to Smart Grids, EECS 352: Engineering Economics and Decision Analysis, and EECS 324: Simulation Techniques in Engineering. I also completed a-year long Teaching Training course, offered by the Center of Educational Services for Students at the Case Wetern Reserve University. During this time, I held frequent meetings with students, led weekly seminars, answered student questions, graded students' homework and projects, created homework solutions, and helped them with their graduate school and job applications.
						</p>
						<p>
						In terms of administrative activities; I held various administrative positions in the student governing body of the Case Western Reserve University during my education including Representative of Nord School of Engineering in the University's Graduate Student Council 2014-2016, Senator of the Electrical Engineering Deparment in the Graduate School Senate 2014-2016, Voting Member of Diekhoff Award Selection Committee 2014-2015, Panelist in Graduate Students' Orientation Sessions 2015, President of the Graduate Student Association  2014-2016, and Elected President of Case Persian Society  2014-2015.
						</p>
						<p>
							I completed the Ph.D. degree in Systems and Control Engineering in February of 2016, under the direction of Prof. Kenneth Loparo. My dissertation is titled "Analytical Tools for Transmission Planning Studies For Offshore Wind Farm Integration." My research was financially supported by the US Department of Energy. As part of team of Case Western Reserve University, FirstEnergy, PJM, GE, and NREL, this research has developed a comprehensive methodology to identify transmission system upgrades that are needed to accommodate offshore wind projects. The findings of this project has been published in form of a General Guidelines for the US Department of Energy to address the unique aspects of interconnection of wind plants to the established transmission grid.
						</p>
						<p>
						After the gradution from the Ph.D., I started as a Research Associate at the Case Western Reserve University. There, I studied the impact of energy storage on flexibility of the distribution systems. This study in collaboration with EPRI and FirstEnergy, focused on investigation of dynamical impacts of deployment of energy storage for frequency regulation technologies in presence of various penetration levels of PV panels across the distributed feeders and microgrids.
						</p>
						<p>
							In October 2016, I moved to the UK and from then, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Dr. Robin Preece and Prof. Jovica Milanovic at the University of Manchester, UK. In this position, I continued my work in power systems dynamics and stability and developed novel techniques, by using big-data analytics, to identify unstable and marginally stable operating conditions in complex power systems dominated by uncertain and volatile generation sources and loads, using high-dimensional data. I also continued my contribution to the administrative duties and sat in the Diversity and Equality committee of the University of Manchester. Hosting the PowerTech 2017 in Manchester was quite fun and a big success. I was a member of "Girls and Boys in Purple" team. Kudos to the Chairman Milanovic, the oraganizing team and everyone who put the event together.
						</p>
						<p>
							I spent the summer of 2018 in Madison, WI, at the Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC), University of Wisconsin-Madison, and worked alongside Prof. Chrsitopher DeMarco and Prof. Bernie Lesieutre. Ever since, I have continued my research on the stability and control of power systems with a more attention to the analytical methods including Lyapunov function.
						</p>
						<p>
							In August 2018, I began a faculty position at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of Case Western Reserve University in the Systems and Control Engineering division. I am continuing my work in stability and control of electric power systems with a particular focus on future systems and proliferation of power-electronics interfaced components.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am indeed indebted to my professors and colleagues who helped me and supperted me to form my career and mature both personally and professionally. Particularly my Ph.D. advisor Dr. Kenneth Loparo and my Ph.D. mentors Prof. Richard Kolacinski and Prof. Mario Garcia-Sanz, my Postdoc supervisors Dr. Robin Preece and Prof. Jovica Milanovic, my master's supervisor Dr. Pitor Biczel as well as the members of my Ph.D. committee, Dr. Marija Prica and Prof. Antonio Conejo. I also am highly appreciative of Prof. Jan Machowski, Prof. Chrsitopher DeMarco, Prof. Bernie Lesieutre, Prof. Vladimir Strezoski, and Prof. Amin Khodaei for generously supporting me.
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside of academics, I enjoy travelling and hiking. I am also highly into sports, playing, coaching and watch. I coach volleyball and recently we won the Greater Manchester's mixed league with Manchester Moss Side Volleyball Club in which I was a coaching staff. I perosnally play football (European football... the correct football... foot... ball) and recently captained the Manchester Thunders. I a big-time supporter of Liverpool football team and the Cleveland Cavaliers.
